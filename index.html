            <p>Hey! Im <strong>Carmen</strong>,
           I have an <i>Associates of Computer Science</i>,
           and currently working towards my <i> Bachelor's of Computer Science with a concentration of
           Software Engneering</i>. Before my technical pursuit, I was working in the Mortgage
           Industry. Although I enjoyed my time in Finance, I was looking for more of
           a scientific challenge, as to why I decided to go back to school. I've always been amazed by the idea of starting with
           <i>nothing</i> and producing <i>something</i>, rather that something is a
            calulator, website, or a video game. What I appreciate most out of learning to code is
           the growth of my problem solving skills and ways to communicate with others on a technical level.
           I indulge in different hobbies outside of school that brings a complete school/work/life balance.
           Those hobbies include: Working on projects to further my technical knowledge, and traveling to explore different
           cultures in order to be more enlighten in diversity.

            <h2 class="display-4">Inspirations</h2>
            <p>I've always been inspired by the <i>evolution of technology</i>, but
          most importantly by the <i>pursuit of happiness</i>. Being able to wake up everyday
          in pursuit of tackling goals, giving back to the community and serving as a resource to
          friends/family/collegues, are the things that inspires me most. Personally there's nothing
          more rewarding than being on a journey that leads towards your personal bliss.
          I take on this challenge everyday as it motivates me to become a better Coder. I look forward
          to this voyage as I become apart of the advancement of technology.

            <p>Within the next 5 years I plan to have finished my Master's in Science with a concentration of Data Science.
          This will give me the education to further explore Big Data and algorithms to further my career. In the interim,
          I plan to progress my knowledge and to become advanced in Object Oriented Programing languages such as Python and Java.
